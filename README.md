# Generation of Nonstationary geological fields using GANs
This repository provides a pytorch implementation of the method used in 
"Generation of non-stationary stochastic fields using Generative Adversarial Networks with limited training data" in https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05469. 

The work is an extenstion of the previous work https://github.com/Alhasan-Abdellatif/cGANs where the method is extended for spatial conditioning using the SPADE algorithm https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE.

The sample notebook provides some examples on how to use the trained models to genereate different geological facies controlled spatailly by a soft map input.
